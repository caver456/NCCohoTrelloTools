# NCCohoTrelloTools
## Tools to extract info and generate reports from a Trello board.

This could be done either by parsing the downloaded json, or, by making API calls.  For now, the code is using API calls.  A very preliminary version that parses the json is also in this repository but is not being maintained.

See [issue #1](https://github.com/caver456/NCCohoTrelloTools/issues/1) for report content checklist and discussion.
